# Furniture Adjustments

## OBJECTIVE / "The-WHY" behind this projects:
When moving to a new flat, I am struggling over and over again, how to furnish my room in such a way that 
I feel comfortable. \
I guess, this is due to my lack of creativty. And most importantly: I suppose, during my studies I didn`t care so much - as long as 
it was afordable, I was ok with it. \
Therefore I want to build a solution for me to struggle less in the future (Python hopefully will do the work for me) and for other persons, who were struggling in the past.
