Why I created this repo and mini-project:
When moving to a new flat, I am struggling over and over again, how to furnish my room in such a way that 
I feel comfortable.

I guess, this is due to my lack of creativty. And most importantly: I suppose, during my studies I didn`t care so much - as long as 
it was afordable. 

Therefore I want to build a solution for me to struggle less in the furture (Python hopefully will do the work for me) and for other persons, who were struggling in the past. 

Thank you for helping and improving this work. 

Best regards
